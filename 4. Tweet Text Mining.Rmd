# Searching for Tweets Related to Climate



```{r}
# load twitter library - the rtweet library is recommended now over twitteR
library(rtweet)
# plotting and pipes - tidyverse!
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
# text mining library
library(tidytext)
# plotting packages
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
```


```{r}
climate_tweets <- search_tweets(q = "#climatechange", n = 10000,
                                      lang = "en",
                                      include_rts = FALSE)
save_as_csv(x = climate_tweets, "climate_tweets.csv", prepend_ids = TRUE, na = "NA",
  fileEncoding = "UTF-8")
```
